# Delayed-Rejection Generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (DRGHMC)

## Work In Progress :construction:

Experiments with novel sampler that excells at high-curvature densities. 

My work for Flatiron Institue internship under [Chirag Modi](https://modichirag.github.io/), [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/), and [Edward Roualdes](https://roualdes.us/).
